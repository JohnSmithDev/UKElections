"""
Map party names/IDs that appear in the CSVs to canonical names.

This is to cover situations like the 2015 CSV having "Green" in the "Party name
identifier" and "Party abbreviation" columns, but "Green Party" in the
2017 CSV "Party Identifer" (sic) column".  Similarly "Labour" vs "Labour and
Co-operative"

Usage:
This currently only maps differences, so *DON'T* do this:

  canonical_party = CANONICAL_PARTY_NAMES[whatever]

Instead do:

  canonical_party = CANONICAL_PARTY_NAMES.get(whatever, whatever)

TODO (maybe): add all party names, in which case the regular dict access might
be OK, although I suspect the number of independents and minor parties will
make this too prone to breakage.
