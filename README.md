# UK Elections reports

Some Python scripts to take publicly accessible data about UK political events
and present it in hopefully interesting and/or useful ways.

## Caveat

This code has been put up on GitHub before I planned to, due to external events.
As such, it's less than ideal in terms of code quality or user-friendliness.

## Dependencies

* Various datasets (see below)
* Python 3

### Optional dependencies

* Python colorama module for nice colour coding

## Datasets

NO DATA IS PROVIDED WITHIN THIS REPO.

Instead you'll have to download it yourself.  This is to be documented properly,
although I think all the relevant URLs are in the code if you grep for http
links.

One downside is that one of the datasets is available only as an Excel file,
at least that I can see.  I manually saved the sheets as a set of CSVs, but
ideally this extra step shouldn't be necessary.

I had intended to have some scripts to automate the grabbing and munging of
the data before I put this up on GitHub, but my hand has slightly been forced
by the Revoke Article 50 petition.
